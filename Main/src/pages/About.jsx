              My name is Anna and I'm a UX Designer with 3 years of experience
              ... and currently on a sidequest to learn how to code! This year I
              want to take my skills to the next level and combine my design
              expertise with more advanced technical proficiency to craft
              holistic digital experiences.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              I built this site entirely from scratch, embracing the
              opportunity to enhance my front-end development skills. Take a look around and thanks for stopping by!
