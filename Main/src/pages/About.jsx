              In my past life, I was a Registered Nurse but for the last 3 years
              UX Design has been my trade. <br></br> <br></br>
              Adding to my artillery, I am currently {" "}

              has really given me a new breadth of knowledge and has improved my
              approaches to creating scalable designs.

              <br></br>I built this site entirely from scratch, which has been a great
              opportunity to enhance my front-end development skills. Feel free to look around!{" "}
